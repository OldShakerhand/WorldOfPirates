## 💰 Economy System

The economy is driven by a server-authoritative **Harbor Master** model. Harbors have unique trade profiles that dictate the prices of goods based on supply and demand.

- **Dynamic Pricing**: Prices vary per harbor. Traders can exploit arbitrage opportunities.
- **Goods**: Tradeable commodities include **Rum**, **Sugar**, **Tobacco**, **Wood**, **Cloth**, and **Food**.
- **Atomic Transactions**: Buying and selling are validated server-side to ensure gold limitations and cargo capacity are respected.
- **Harbor Profiles**: Some harbors are rich in luxury goods like Sugar, while others are industrial hubs for Wood and Cloth.
